# 🧠 Shaping Frame

A cognitive layer for Claude that tracks epistemic weight during complex working
sessions: what is still a hypothesis, what has been decided, and what Claude
generated but you have not validated yet.

It does not produce output on its own. It surfaces only when something starts
crossing a threshold without your explicit approval.

## 📦 Install

From a Claude Desktop chat:

```text
+ -> Skills -> Manage Skills
```

This opens Claude's `Customize > Skills` area.

In the Skills panel, click the `+` button in the center column, then choose:

```text
+ Create skill -> Upload a skill
```

Install `shaping-frame.skill`.

Do not stop in the public skills directory. For this file, use:

```text
+ Create skill -> Upload a skill
```

## 🧭 Activate

Add the contents of `CUSTOM_INSTRUCTION.txt` to `Instructions for Claude`.

In Claude Desktop:

```text
initials -> Settings -> Instructions for Claude
```

This is required. Without it, Claude may treat this like any other skill and
summarize it instead of running it in full.

## ⚠️ Known limit

Claude does not run this skill through a background hook before each write or
decision. The frame is reconstructed through the conversation context and the
custom instruction anchor.

In long or fast sessions, some threshold crossings may be missed. That is a
host constraint, not a skill defect.

## 🤖 AI-assisted development

This project was developed with AI assistance.

The project, documentation, and repository materials were shaped through
human-directed work supported by AI tools during drafting, structuring, review,
and refinement.

AI assistance does not make the project automatically correct, complete, or

## 🧠 What This Skill Is

Shaping Frame is not a file tool, code tool, writing template, memory layer, or
general prompt style.

It is a session-level cognitive frame for Claude Chat/Desktop. Its job is to
track epistemic weight while the conversation is still moving: ideas,
constraints, imported material, Claude-generated proposals, model priors, and
operator decisions.

The core failure mode it targets is silent promotion. A phrase, suggestion,
assumption, or imported fragment gets repeated, reused, or built on until it
starts behaving like a decision, even though the operator never approved it.

## 📦 Package Structure

Published unit:

```text
shaping-frame.skill
```

The package contains:

```text
shaping-frame/SKILL.md
shaping-frame/references/frame.md
shaping-frame/references/dogana.md
shaping-frame/references/snapshot.md
```

## 🧭 Activation Model

Claude Chat/Desktop does not provide a hook layer for this skill. There is no
automatic pre-write interception and no persistent runtime guard.

The custom instruction is therefore part of the operating model. It acts as the
always-on floor that tells Claude to read and apply the skill as a full frame,
not as a normal reference to summarize.

The skill package provides the full frame and reference files. The custom
instruction anchors the expectation that the frame is active during working
sessions.

## 🧩 Source Classes

The frame separates source classes because each class carries a different kind
of authority:

- `OP`: operator intent, correction, constraint, or decision
- `EXT`: external material brought into the conversation
- `AI`: Claude-generated proposal inside the session
- `MP`: model prior, convention, or generic assumption
- `DSK`: documentary state from uploaded or available material

`OP` decides direction. `DSK` describes available evidence. `EXT` is relevant
because the operator brought it, but relevance is not approval. `AI` and `MP`
start low unless the operator validates them.

## ⚖️ Weight States

The skill tracks movement through states:

- `Spark`: raw intuition or early idea
- `Candidate`: possible direction, not decided
- `Tracked`: gaining operational weight without approval
- `Crystallized`: approved by the operator
- `Rejected`: discarded and tracked to prevent return through inertia

It also uses flags:

- `Quarantined`: useful but unsafe for structural output
- `Contaminated`: carries conversational residue or embedded assumptions
- `Needs verification`: requires documentary, tool, or external verification
  before grounding a factual or technical decision

## 🚧 Thresholds

The checkpoint fires when material starts crossing a structural boundary:

```text
proposal -> premise
premise -> constraint
constraint -> decision
decision -> artifact
draft -> spec
provisional phrase -> naming
local compromise -> architecture
AI/MP/EXT -> implicit OP
factual hypothesis -> technical foundation
```

When one of these crossings starts to happen, the skill can surface a compact
checkpoint instead of letting the material continue silently.

## 📡 Surface Behavior

The frame is active every turn, but it should not emit tracking output every
turn.

It surfaces when:

- a new constraint or external material enters the session
- the operator changes direction or scope
- the operator asks where things stand
- a draft begins turning into a spec
- a name, rule, architecture, or reusable artifact is about to crystallize
- a Claude-generated or model-prior element starts acting like operator intent

Output should stay compact: inline tags when enough, checkpoint blocks when
needed, and a stop only when unvetted material would become structural.

## 🕰️ Anti-Recency Rule

The latest formulation does not automatically win.

If two elements conflict, the frame requires Claude to separate them by source,
state, and weight. A recent statement wins only when it is an explicit operator
correction, revocation, or decision.

This matters because long shaping sessions often create false decisions through
conversation inertia.

## 🧷 Custom Instruction Anchor

`CUSTOM_INSTRUCTION.txt` is not part of the `.skill` archive. It must be added
to `Instructions for Claude` separately.

Its purpose is narrow: force full-read behavior and keep the frame active as a
working posture. Without it, Claude may treat the skill like ordinary reference
material and compress it before applying it.

## ⚠️ Host Limits

This skill cannot guarantee perfect continuity. Claude Chat/Desktop does not
give the skill a persistent hook or a separate enforcement layer.

The skill reduces drift by making threshold crossings visible. It does not
eliminate drift.
